PhenIX, Phenotypic Interpretation of eXomes, is a pipeline for ranking (prioritizing) candidate genes in exomes or 
NGS panels with comprehensive coverage of human Mendelian disease genes. It ranks genes based on predicted variant 
pathogenicity as well as phenotypic similarity of diseases associated with the genes harboring these variants to the 
phenotypic profile of the individual being investigated, based on analysis 
powered by the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). 

The method has been published in Science Translational Medicine:
