The [Phenomizer](http://compbio.charite.de/phenomizer) is a software that aims to help clinicians to identify the correct differential diagnosis in the field of human genetics.
The user enters the signs/symptoms of the patient encoded as terms from the [Human Phenotype Ontology](http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org). 
The software then ranks all diseases from OMIM, Orphanet, and DECIPHER by a score that reflects how well the phenotypic profiles of the patient
and the disease match to each other. Further details can be found in the publication.


The software is [available here](http://compbio.charite.de/phenomizer).
