#Genomics 2014/2015

This Genomics course is being offered in the FU Master's Program in Bioinformatics (CUB848). The lectures will take place on Tuesdays on 14-16h and are accompanied by recitals (Ãœbungen) on Thursday from 8-10h (cum multo tempore, i.e., we will begin punctually at 8:30h). Lecture slides and handouts for the recitals will be made available from this webpage.
