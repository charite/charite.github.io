We believe that open-source software is essential for progress in bioinformatics. Although in many cases a methodological description of a novel algorithm is sufficient for those skilled in the art to implement it, oftentimes a textual description of an involved algorithms is ambiguous to a degree that hinders reproducibility of results. Therefore, we subscribe to the idea that source code should be provided for at least the essential aspects of novel bioinformatic algorithms, being in a way comparable to the methods section of a wetlab publication.

Therefore, we have made as much of our software open-source as has been practicable under one of the GNU or BSD licenses. See the projects for the details. For projects in which large amounts of data from one or more sources are investigated using databases and scripts, it appears more useful to provide a detailed methodological description of the project, especially if no novel algorithmic developments are involved. Users desiring to reproduce our results or embark on a similar project are more likely to use tools adapted to their own tastes and hardware.
