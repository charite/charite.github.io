title: Common Disease Network
---

A web-app to explore common diseases
===========
We have developed a web application that allows interactive exploration of a network of common diseases. The edges between the common diseases are based on similarity of the phenotypic profiles of the two diseases. If the similarity exceeds a threshold, we draw an edge, otherwise not. The similarity is calculated using the [Human Phenotype Ontology](http://human-phenotype-ontology.org).

 Availability
------------
The application is available at [http://compbio.charite.de/CDN/cdn.html](http://compbio.charite.de/CDN/cdn.html)
