**Welcome!**

The CBCB is located at the Institute for Medical Genetics and Human 
Genetics at <a href="http://www.charite.de" target="_new1">Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin</a>. 

We focus on the identification and characterization of pathogenic sequence variants in patients with rare genetic diseases. For the prioritization of candidate mutations we consider their impact on the structural organization of the genome and the phenotype of the patient. Deep phenotyping is based on automated face recognition.
