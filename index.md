**Welcome!**

The CBCB is located at the Institute for Medical Genetics and Human 
Genetics at <a href="http://www.charite.de" target="_new1">Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin</a>. 

Our group develops the <a href="http:///www.human-phenotype-ontology.org" target="_new2">Human Phenotype Ontology</a> and applications of this ontology to differential diagnositics and genomics analyses. 

We develop algorithms for exome and genome sequencing, ChIP-seq, immunogenomics, and other genomics applications, Gene Ontology analysis,
computational phenotype analysis, as well as various algorithms from the fields of Machine 
Learning and modeling of biological networks with the tools of linear 
algebra and graph theory. 

We also collaborate on the computational analysis of wetlab biological data, especially in the fields of human hereditary disease and the molecular basis of bone development and fracture healing.
