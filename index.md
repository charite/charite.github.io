**Welcome!**

The CBCB is located at the Institute for Medical Genetics and Human 
Genetics at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin. We develop algorithms and 
applications in the field of the Human Phenotype Ontology, Gene Ontology, Phenotypic Analysis, Machine 
Learning, and modeling of biological networks with the tools of linear 
algebra and graph theory. 

We also collaborate on the computational analysis 
of wetlab biological data, especially in the fields of human hereditary disease 
and the molecular basis of bone development and fracture healing.
