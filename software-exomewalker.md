title: ExomeWalker
---

ExomeWalker is a computational method to prioritise a set of candidates in exome sequencing projects that aim to identify novel Mendelian disease genes. 
Genes are prioritised according to a variant score (predicted pathogenicity, rarity, pattern of variants compatible with the assumed mode of inheritance) and to their vicinity to other genes that belong to the same disease-gene family within the protein protein interaction (PPI) network, using the Random-Walk method as described previously to determine similarity within the PPI network on the basis of the global characteristics of the network.
