>The group for computational biology and bioinformatics at the Institute for Medical Genetics at the Charité offers challenging internships, bachelor and masterthesis for interested students of Computer Sciences and Bioinformatics.


**Next Generation Sequencing**

Sequencing techniques of the second generation are revolutionizing genetics. These high through-put techniques generate several orders of magnitude more sequencing data and challenge bioinformaticians. We use a Genome Analyzer II for genome wide mutation screening.
We will sketch three projects, that could be dealt within the scope of a software engineering internship or *Berufspraktikum* of 8 weeks:

 * After a sequencing run the raw data consists of millions of short sequence reads that have to be aligned to a reference sequence before further analysis. After the alignment, one is interested how well the genomic region of interest is covered by short reads. The goal of this software internship is the development of a automatized pipeline, that computes the coverage of the target region an further meaningful statistics of a sequencing run.
 * NGS data sets as well as array CGH  data sets generate a plethora of candidate mutation and copy number variation, that have to be validated using standard techniques. This requires the design of oligonucleotide primer sequences. The goal of this software internship is to further develop a pipeline, that generates for a given genomic position or interval the appropriate validation primer sequences.



**Human Phenotype Ontology**

The Human Phenotype Ontology project requires new interfaces for exploring, visualising and improve the ontology. The student should develop Java-servlets for these tasks.

Application of the HPO to different fields in the life science domain, especially for transferring knowledge from rare and genetic diseases to other fields.

Possible projects are:

 * Improve the user-interfaces
 * New algorithmic ideas to be implemented/tested to improve the performance of Disease Gene Prediction
 
 
 >All software projects deal with topics that are also of high interest to the research community. Commited students may be able to publish their work in scientific journals. For the projects described above interested students should contact Peter Robinson, Sebastian Köhler and Peter Krawitz. Ideally, the student should already have good programming skills in Perl, Java, C++ or comparable programming languages.
