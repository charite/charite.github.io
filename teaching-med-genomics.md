Medical Genomics 2016
------------------
This is the homepage for the practicum (Praxisseminar) on Medical Genomics (Aktuelle Fragestellungen aus der medizinischen Genomik, Master Bioinformatik, Freie Universität Berlin). This is an English-language practical course that aims to provide students with know-how to perform and understand state-of-the-art bioinformatics analysis in medical genomics. The topic for the Summer semester 2016 is Exome Sequencing.

Grading
-------
Each session will consist of practical exercises and explanations and will have a homework assignment that you will turn in the subsequent week. This will count for 20% of your grade. Late assignments will not be accepted except if there is a good reason such as a medical attest (Krankschreibung). However, the worst 3 assignment grades will be dropped. There will be a final examination that will count for 80% of your grade.

The way this course will work
----------------------------
There will be a handout each week that will guide you through practical exercises on the topic at hand and also will contain homework questions (practical and theoretical). We will provide the handout via a class DropBox repository.



Schedule
------------------
The course will be held on Wednesdays starting on April 20, 2016.
