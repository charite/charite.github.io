The Exomiser is a Java program that functionally annotates and prioritises variants from whole-exome sequencing data starting from a 
VCF file.

The Exomiser has been developed by our group, the Mouse Informatics Group at the Sanger Institute, and other members of the [Monarch initiative](http://monarchinitiative.org/).

The website can be [found here](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/exomiser/).

The underlying algorithms and software have been published in several articles.
